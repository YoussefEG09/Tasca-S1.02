🚀 Java Input Validation & Custom Exceptions Project 🎉
🔍 Overview

This project focuses on mastering input validation and exception handling in Java, divided into two exciting levels:

🌟 Nivel 1: Sales System

Create Product and Sale classes

Handle empty sales with a custom exception (SaleEmptyException)

Practice collection handling and error management

🌟 Nivel 2: Safe User Input

Build an Entry class with static methods to read various data types from the console safely

Use Java exceptions and a custom FormatErrorException for input validation

Keep prompting the user until valid input is received
